# SortingAlgorithms-in-Swift
A few easy sorting algorithms implemented in swift and used in swiftUI


## Bubble-Sort
The `bubbleSort` function iterates over the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are out of order. 
This process is repeated until the array is fully sorted.

## Insertion-Sort
A `key` is compared with a element before the current one (`previousIndex`) and the function shift them one position to the right if they are greater than the key. The process is continued until the function finds the correct position for the `key` or reach the beginning of the array.
